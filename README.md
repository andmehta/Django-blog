# Django-blog
Take home assessment for First Principles Publishing

## Requirements:

Design and implement a RESTful API using either Python Flask or Django.
The API should have endpoints for:
- Creating a new blog post
- Retrieving a list of all blog posts
- Retrieving a single blog post by its ID
- Updating an existing blog post
- Deleting a blog post
- Implement basic authentication for the API. Users should be able to sign up, sign in, and authenticate their requests to create, update, or delete blog posts.
- Use a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store blog post data.
- Write unit tests to ensure the reliability of your code.

## Evaluation Criteria:

Code Quality: Assess the cleanliness, readability, and organization of the code. Look for the effective use of coding best practices and design patterns.
System Architecture: Evaluate the architecture of the system, considering factors such as scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.
RESTful Design: Check if the API endpoints adhere to RESTful principles and conventions.
Authentication: Verify the implementation of authentication mechanisms and security measures.
Database Usage: Evaluate the interaction with the chosen database, including data modeling and query optimization.
Testing: Review the completeness and effectiveness of the unit tests.

## Submission Guidelines:

Provide the source code of your project, along with any necessary setup instructions.
Include documentation explaining your design decisions, trade-offs made, and any additional features or improvements you would have implemented with more time.
